I'm starting to see more and more around me that python programming is a necessity in a wider range of jobs, from distant 
domains like law and accounting to closely related fields such as data analysis. Obviously, this is because of LLMs which <em>apparently</em>
makes the barrier of entry into programming a lot lower. 

This is done at the expense of the job satisfactions of these LLM programmers. What I see is a painful continuous daily 
banging of heads against <em>the chatGPT wall</em>. They ask for a programming solution and the LLM gives an answer which is 99% there, but doesn't
actually work, and then they copy the error into chatGPT, which again gives a wrong answer and then again and again. Not interested in learning python,
the LLM programmer cannot escape the loop. Which leads to frustration and a lower job satisfaction for many. 

Programming is a skill, not knowledge, and can't be learned like you learn about WW2. It is a craft, learned through practice,
not a theory to be memorized. You need to learn programming by doing  it with your hands many months, which is time that the LLM programmer doesn't have.
