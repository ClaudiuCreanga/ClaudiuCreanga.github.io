<p>I am a Romanian developer, currently working in <i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i> London, UK.</p>
<p>I quite like <span>magento</span> and love to build on top of it. On frontend I mostly work with <span>sass</span> and <span>foundation</span>. I have also experience with Wordpress.
<p><span>node js</span> is one thing that I would like to work on in the future.</p>
<p>Most of Google's web products are on my radar, especially <span>analytics</span> and <span>angular</span></p>
<p>For fun I enjoy trying <span>Python</span> and <span>RoR</span></p>
<p>To see my projects you can check my <a href="https://github.com/ClaudiuCreanga/" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-github-alt"></i></a>. BTW, this is a <span>jekyll</span> blog hosted on Github Pages. </p>
<p>I have a masters in philosophy and when I have time I like to read good philosophy books.</p>
<p>Movies: Coen Brothers and Ghibli are on top. More about this in the stuff section. </p>
