  <ul class="stuff lists cool-bullet">
  	  <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094716/" target="_blank">The Beast of War</a> - 3 tankists in a Soviet tank that are followed by the local fighters in Afganisthan. The commander is a sort of Ahab, but the whale is saving and protecting his tank, even at the expense of his crew. 
      </li>
  	  <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092593/" target="_blank">Au Revoir Les Enfants</a> - a very good movie about French children during the WWII. 
      </li>
  	  <li>
      	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Como" target="_blank">Lake Como</a> and its villages are really nice and worth a trip. I don't know why it isn't more popular on tourist maps. If you are in Milan, it certainly pays off if you go north just one hour by car and you will be in cool small villages like Bellagio, Como and Lecco. 
      </li>
  	  <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1276104/" target="_blank">Looper</a> - Decent action movie that has some clever ideas. Gives you goosebumps how old Bruce Willis is, but he still loves making action movies. 
      </li>
	  <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1637688/" target="_blank">In Time</a> - a very good idea but unfortunately the script and the actors aren't on par. Money is time and rich people gamble with centuries while poor people have only days. 
      </li>
	  <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059183/" target="_blank">The Flight of the Phoenix</a> - movie about men living on the ragged edge of survival. They managed to work together and save themselves without getting along with each other or surrender their own values. Another classic performance by James Stewart, this time in a non-Hitchcock movie.
      </li>
	  <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3170832/" target="_blank">Room</a> - one of the most emotional movies I've ever seen. 
      </li>
	  <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097216" target="_blank">Do the Right Thing</a> - about a pizzeria in a mostly black neighbourhood. Still relevant today. 
      </li>
      <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3966404/" target="_blank">Mustang</a> is a nice coming-of-age Turkish movie that I recommend. 
      </li>
      <li>
      	<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1853614/" target="_blank">Momo e no tegami</a> is quite a nice anime. Although not a Ghibli, still quite similar in interests. Worth seeing it. 
      </li>
